## Description

Adds several rectangular platforms. The blob is drawn as a noisy circle but collides using a simple axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). X and Y are resolved separately to keep behaviour predictable and teachable.

## Interatcion Notes

Change the blob color and noise factor to express the emotion.
When blob on the ground blob shows green and regular shape to express joy, when blob in the air it shows red and irregular noise express unsteadiness.

## Assets

## GenAI
